                        has arguably
                        been the highlight of Pakistan’s cricket this past year, scoring runs all over the world
                        including in bowler-friendly conditions of Australia and New Zealand.
                        <br> <br>
                        He was also the top-scorer in two of the three Twenty20 international matches in the recently
                        concluded series against South Africa and was also named Player of the Series in both Tests and
                        T20Is for his ravishing performances with the bat and gloves.

                        He was part of the Karachi Kings' squad in last year's PSL but was kept on the bench for the
                        entirety of the tournament's fifth edition and could prove to be a costly slip for the defending
                        champions as his heavy striking game has improved considerably over the past year.
                        <br><br>
                        Commenting on Rizwan's captaincy, Multan Sultans owner Alamgir Khan Tareen said the
                        wicketkeeper-batsman has "shown exemplary leadership qualities with the Pakistan team as well as
                        with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in domestic tournaments".
                        <br><br>
                        "He is presently one of the very best in the world in his position and we are excited to have
                        him lead our team," Tareen said in a statement shared by the franchise on Twitter.
                        <br><br>
                        The owner also expressed his gratitude to former captain Masood for "leading the franchise
                        exceptionally well last season and for instilling a winning mentality within the team".
                        <br><br>
                        Meanwhile, Rizwan said he had "understood the innovative approach the franchise applied last
                        season" and was looking to leading the team and playing his part.
                        <br><br>
                        Multan Sultans would aspire to be even better this season, he added.
                        <br><br>
                        "I am grateful to the owner and the head coach for this opportunity, and shall, God willing,
                        repay the franchise for the trust that they've shown in me with positive results on the field,"
                        the statement quoted Rizwan as saying.
